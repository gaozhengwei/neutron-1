[ml2_hp]
# (IntOpt) Set the interval(in seconds) for synchronizing 
# port and network configuration from the network server 
# to physical devices. 
# The default is 300 seconds.
#
# sync_time =
# Example: sync_time = 600

# (StrOpt) Specify the OEM for all physical devices.
# The default is HP. Supported OEMs are HP and H3C.
#
# oem =
# Example: oem = HP

# (StrOpt) Specify the username and password used 
# for establishing NETCONF and RESTful connections
# with physical devices. 
# Physical devices must be configured with the same 
# username and password.
#
# There is no default value for these two options.
# You must set these options.
#
# username =
# password = 
# Example: username = test
# Example: password = test

# (StrOpt) Specify the encapsulation protocol for NETCONF,
# Options include HTTPS and HTTP.
# The default is HTTPS.
# 
# schema =
# Example: schema = HTTPS 

# (StrOpt) Specify the method for sending configuration.
# Options include NETCONF and RESTful.
# The default is NETCONF.
#
# rpc_backend =
# Example: rpc_backend = NETCONF 

# Leaf Topology Format.
# [ml2_hp_leaf:<IP address of leaf switch>]
# <hostname>=[InterfaceName1,InterfaceName2,...]
# ...
# For each host connected to an interface of a leaf switch,
# specify the host name and the interface name.
# 
# If a host is connected to multiple interfaces on the leaf switch,
# use comma as the delimeter between interface names.
#
# An interface name can be a full name or an abbreviated name.
#
# Valid interface types include GigabitEthernet, 
# Ten-GigabitEthernet, and FortyGigE.
#
# Example:
# [ml2_hp_leaf:1.1.1.2]
# compute-1 = G1/0/1,G1/0/2
# compute-2 = Ten1/0/2
# network-1 = Forty1/0/8

# Spine Topology Format
# [ml2_hp_spine:<IP address of spine>:<IP address of leaf>]
# <spine_port1> = <leaf_port1>  
# ...
# The left represents an interface on a spine device.
# The right represents an interface on a leaf device 
# that is connected to the spine device.
# 
# Example:
# [ml2_hp_spine:1.1.1.1:1.1.1.2]
# G1/0/1 = G1/0/1
# G1/0/2 = G1/0/3
